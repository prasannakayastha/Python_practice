What it will do:

Let the user add grocery items with their name (string), price (float), and quantity (int).

Store items in a list of dictionaries.

Calculate the total bill.

Use an if condition to give a discount if the total is above a certain amount.

Loop until the user says they are done.

Demonstrate all data types: int, float, str, bool, list, dict.



Next things 
What to do next (recommendations for a beginner)

Input validation

Right now, if the user types text instead of a number, the program will crash.

Next step: add checks to handle wrong input (like try/except).

Format the output

Show each item in a neat list (like a receipt).

Example: "2kg of Apples at $3/kg → $6"

Functions for each task

One function to collect groceries.

Another to calculate total.

Another to apply discounts.

This makes code easier to test and expand.

Add more rules

Different discount rates (e.g., 20% if > $50).

“Buy one get one free” or item-specific discounts.

Explore saving data

Save the shopping list to a file (.txt or .json) so you can reopen it later.
